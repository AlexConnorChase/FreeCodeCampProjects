# FreeCodeCampProjects
This repo is a collection of projects I worked on provided by freecodecamp.org 

These works provide certifications in areas across coding, from front end to back, including courses on machine learning and database management.

Please Note: I did NOT make all of these from scratch, these are mostly guided lessons to teach the fundametal aspects of the respective module.

For instance the Responsive Front End module (the first one) has guided lessons revovling around HTML and CSS concepts.

The only projects I own in this repo are tagged "Final" and are the final projects for each section in an module. These projects are open ended and provide a set of user stories that must be met for completion.
