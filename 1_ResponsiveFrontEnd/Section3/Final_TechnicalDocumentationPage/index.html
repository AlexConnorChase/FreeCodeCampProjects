        <p> Zoanthropy <code>(zōˈan(t)thrəpē)</code> is a general term used to describe the conditions in which a person may adopt animal-like traits and appearances during supernatural phenomena or granted by arcane rituals.</p>
        <p>Many forms of the Zoanthropes exist, with the most common categories as follows: Wolves, Bears, Tigers, Lions, Rats, Swine, Snakes, Lizards, and Drakes.</p>
        <p> The majority of these forms are believed to have originated from two sources: the arcane supression of non-human traits in hybrid species; and second the early attempts to use arcane rituals to enhance the physical form using essence taken from various cratures.</p>

        <p>Common aspects of Zoanthrope diets can vary based on the type of creature or hybrid being addressed. Across the board Zoanthropes are omnivorous however their diets lean closer to their non-human apsect.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All Zoanthropes will crave high-protein diets during their transformations due to the drastic changes in size and shape.
          </li>
          <li>
            These tranformations can remain incomplete if the body lacks the proper materials to fully transform
          </li>
          <li>
            Part of the aggression noticed during these periods is caused by discomfort and hunger from incomplete transformations
          </li>
          <li>
            A complete transformation has been shown to decrease aggression and restore higher cognitive functions
          </li>
          <li>
            Supplements are available to aid in complete transformations as a short-term treatment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the case you come across an individual experiencing an incomplete transformation, please use caution and remove yourself from the area. Proceed to call the provided hotline number with your location, our local branches will dispatch a management team to provide relief treatment to the afflicted person.While it is true that Zoanthropes are not inherently dangerous, pain and discomfort can cause anyone, transformation or not, to act in unpredictable ways.</p>

        <p>While many have accused these transformations to be a form of "blood curse", the reality of modern arcanological studies imply that the actual curse is the supression or alteration of one's natural traits. A common misconception is that being bitten during a Zoanthrope's transformation period can spread the supposed curse to the victim, these claims are mostly false outside of specific cases involving a <code>Turning Ritual</code> or wild magic.</p>
        <p> In the case of human hybrids it is most common to see one inherit a <code>lineage seal</code> which alters an individual to appear purely human, as well as their subsequent offspring. This seal like others of it's kind were not designed to perform at a constant pace, thus we see times where the seal temporarily cycles off to recharge and perform maintenance, most often during the astrological phenomena such as full moons or eclipses where arcane energy becomes more malleable. During these maintenance periods the individual experiences a painful transitioning process as the magic holding their form abruptly ends.</p>
        <p>Those who undergo rituals to inherit non-human traits undergo a similar process by using studies found within the anciet schools of enchantment and transmutation to infuse essence taken from various creatures onto themselves. This process, often reffered to as <code>Transfusion</code> carries side-effects due to the nuances of transformation. It is currently believed that the emotional state of the creature at the time the essence (usually blood) was taken from them. This in turn affected the mental state of the individual by infusing the creature's fear or anger, causing unpredictabele and often violent behaviors. These traits are very rarely passed on to the individual's offspring, but varies on the amount of essence tranfused in the parents.</p>
        <p>If you or a loved one is affected by these traits it's highly recommended you contact our local branches to discuss possible treatment and management options. While all instances are handled on a case-by-case basis, we have resources available on our most common treatments: <code>Seal Breaking</code>, <code>Seal Optimization</code>, and <code>Transfusion Neutralization</code>.</p>
